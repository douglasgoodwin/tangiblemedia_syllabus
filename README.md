# Course Overview

**Tuesday & Thursday**\
**9:00AM - 11:50AM**\
**FabLab (Broad 2250)**

Professor: [Douglas Goodwin](mailto:dgoodwin@gmail.com)  (office hours: Tuesday 1:00-2:00PM in the FabLab and by appointment)\
TA: [Aurora Mititelu](mailto:ucaurora95@g.ucla.edu) (office hours: TBD)

In this course, you will use basic electronics and the open-source Arduino platform to create three interactive projects of increasing difficulty. By the end of the course, you will have gained practical experience in designing and building tangible media systems that bridge the virtual and physical worlds.

### Working with electronics opens new pathways to connect the virtual and physical—from ephemeral representations on screens and networks to tangible interactions in space and time. Through a combination of workshops, readings, lectures, critiques, and discussions, we will evaluate the role of traditional desktop computers (along with their mice, trackpads, keyboards, screens, and gamepads) in shaping our understanding of what is technically possible, sensible, logical, foolish, magical, and intuitive.

### Core Competencies

In this course, each participant will build an understanding of:

* Electricity and circuit design
* Mechanisms and sensors
* Actuators and micro-controller programming
* Custom interface design
* Integrating electronics with software

All assignments must be documented and archived. Class time will be used to learn skills, fabricate objects, execute projects, and discuss student work.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Critically evaluate the relationships between hardware, software, and interface.
* Confidently prototype electronics projects.
* Effectively work in a mixed physical-digital environment and laboratory setting.
* Utilize standard hardware and software tools proficiently.
* Develop strong project planning and research skills.
* Apply techniques and methodologies for debugging projects.
* Use digital fabrication tools to create and realize their projects.

### Grading

* **75% – Projects**
* **25% – Engagement throughout the course** (active participation and substantive contribution to the weekly critiques and discussions)

**Note:** In addition to being presented for critique, all projects must be thoroughly documented before receiving a grade. Documentation must include photos and video where necessary, a title, and a description of the work. We will try to reserve the shootroom for documentation twice during the quarter to facilitate this process.

### Participation & Attendance

Punctuality, focus, articulation of concepts, and contribution to class discussions are all part of class participation.

* You get one unexcused absence, no questions asked. Each unexcused absence after that will result in one full letter grade deduction.
* Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in the class.
* If there is an emergency and you will be late or absent from class, please email me and the TA _before_ class.
* Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances.
* Illness requires a doctor’s note.

#### Tardiness

* Classes start at 9:00 AM. If you arrive after 9:15 but before 10:00, you will receive a tardy.
* Three tardies will be marked as an unexcused absence.
* You will be marked as absent if you arrive after 10:00 AM without prior approval.

### Workload

The Tangible Media course is a 5-unit studio class, meaning you should allocate approximately 15 hours per week to the course. Generally, 6 of these hours are spent in class, with the remaining 9 hours dedicated to work outside of class. Each week, we expect to see progress that reflects this 15-hour weekly commitment.

### STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS

Students with a disability or health-related issue who need a class accommodation should make an appointment to speak with the instructor as soon as possible. It is University policy that students with documented disabilities receive reasonable accommodations through access to classroom information. If you have a physical, psychological/psychiatric or medical condition, or a learning disability that will make it difficult for you to carry out the work outlined in the syllabus, or that will require additional time for taking exams and completing assignments, please notify your faculty for this class and visit the [UCLA Center for Accessible Education](https://www.cae.ucla.edu/) in the first two weeks of the quarter so that we may make appropriate arrangements. All information and documentation is confidential.

### COMMITMENT TO EQUITY AND DIVERSITY

We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.

### LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Tongva, Kizh Kit’c, Gabrieleño, and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it through generations. While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination.
