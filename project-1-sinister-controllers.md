# Project 1: Sinister controllers

**Final Demonstration on Thursday, 10/31**

We communicate with computers and most games using physical interfaces. Switches, keyboards, pointing devices, and touch surfaces define how we interact with machines. Interactions with machines matured at the end of the last century, and controllers have changed little since.

### The goal of this project is to disrupt the controller by creating a chain of sinister controllers to communicate a one-bit signal _in the least efficient way possible!_

Taking inspiration from Peter Fischli and David Weiss's installation "The Way Things Go" (German: Der Lauf der Dinge). The Swiss artists created a 100-foot-long sequence in their ZÃ¼rich warehouse studio, incorporating materials such as tires, trash bags, ladders, soap, oil drums, old shoes, water, and gasoline. Fire and pyrotechnics were used as chemical triggers. Although you can't use fire or dangerous chemicals (fuels or irritants), you will adhere to the spirit of complexity and inefficiency seen in the film.

Each student's project will fit into this overall scheme, creating a complex, interconnected chain where every controller plays its part in forwarding a one-bit signal with elaborate and inefficient means. The final assembly/installation will take place outside our workspace on 10/31.

### Assignment

Create part of **(Sinister) Control**: a chain of devices that communicates a one-bit signal (GO or NO GO) from beginning to end. Each individual controller must convert one type of signal/input into another type of signal/output using physical means, adhering to these rules:

### Six Rules

1. Each student project will feature a standard button to receive the message.
2. Youe project must receive the message (a button press) and send that message (another button press) in a period of time greater than 3 seconds and less than 30 seconds.
3. All messages are simple, one-bit interactions like the ones that you see in the film.
4. Translating the message may be done physically, electronically, or by programming an Arduino.
5. Projects will be placed on the tables and must fit inside a volume equal to a cubic foot.
6. No fire, no fuel, no toxic chemicals!

### Final Demonstration

Students will install, run, and document **(Sinister) Control** on the deck outside the FabLab on **10/31**.
