# Project 2: Encode/Decode

Final Demonstration on Tuesday, 11/19

### Objective

This project challenges teams of two students to transmit a message through an arbitrary medium, encoding and decoding a given message using the specified or randomly chosen media. One student will be responsible for encoding and sending the message, and the other for receiving and decoding it. A successful project will accurately restore the original message.&#x20;

This project is based on Claude Shannon's 1948 work in Communication Theory, which abstracted human communication into channels. Shannon's communication channel consisted of a sender (a source of information), a transmission medium (with noise and distortion), and a receiver (whose goal is to reconstruct the sender's messages). Encoding and decoding were implied, though Shannon was working with the telephone company and the messages were human voices compressed by the medium of the telephone network.

### Assignment

Work in teams of two. Your task is to send a message and encode it into a form that can be communicated through a  medium and then restored to the original message. Both message and medium will be established by playing a white elephant game.&#x20;

### Medium

* Steel pipe
* Buzzer
* Single-color LED
* RGB LED
* Motor
* Proximity sensor
* Button
* Light sensor
* Wire

### Message

* The number 42
* Forward / left / right / back
* Rick Astley’s "Never Gonna Give You Up"
* 64x64 pixel image of Pikachu
* The first five notes of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony
* The color blue
* The "I have a dream" speech.

### "White Elephant" Gift Exchange for assigning messages and mediums

In this special "White Elephant" gift exchange, the gifts are cards that indicate either a **message** or a **medium**. This engaging activity ensures a fun and interactive way for students to select the key elements they will use in their Encode/Decode projects.

#### Materials Needed:

* Cards with pre-written messages (e.g., "The number 42," "Forward/left/right/back," "Rick Astley’s 'Never Gonna Give You Up'," etc.).
* Cards with pre-written mediums (e.g., "Steel pipe," "Buzzer," "RGB LED," etc.).
* A basket or box to hold all the cards (both messages and mediums mixed together).
* Numbered slips for determining the order in which students will pick.

### Assignment

Encode the given message into the selected medium.

Decode the transmitted message back into its original form.

### Examples

#### A. Number to Color

You will need to decide how to encode and decode the number into a color.

MESSAGE: The number 42.

MEDIUM: An RGB LED.

#### B. Image to Sound

Decide how to encode the pixel values (and position) into strikes on the steel pipe.

MESSAGE: A 64x64 pixel image of Pikachu.

MEDIUM: A steel pipe.

#### C. Directional Commands

Decide how to encode and decode specific messages (forward, back, left, right) into LED flashes.

MESSAGE: Forward, back, left, right.

MEDIUM: A red LED.

### Final Demonstration

Students will install, run, and document their projects outside the FabLab on 11/19. Be prepared to present your project, explaining your encoding and decoding processes and all the challenges you faced.
